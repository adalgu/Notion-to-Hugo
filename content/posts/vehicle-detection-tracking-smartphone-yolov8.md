title: Building a Real-Time Vehicle Detection and Tracking System on Your Smartphone
---

### 

Introduction
Welcome back! In the first part, we discussed the basics of speed measurement and the technologies involved. Now, we will move on to the practical implementation of detecting and tracking vehicles using YOLOv8 and DeepSORT.

1. Installing and Setting Up YOLOv8
First, you need to install the YOLOv8 model. YOLOv8 can be installed via the Ultralytics library.

2. Capturing Video from Your Smartphone
You can use OpenCV to capture video from your smartphone’s camera.

3. Implementing Object Tracking with DeepSORT
DeepSORT helps in maintaining the identity of vehicles across multiple frames. Here’s how you can integrate it:

4. Displaying the Results
Use OpenCV to display the video with detected and tracked vehicles.

Conclusion
In this part, we implemented the basics of vehicle detection and tracking using YOLOv8 and DeepSORT. In the final part, we will focus on calculating the speed of the detected vehicles and integrating GPS data for more accurate measurements.
