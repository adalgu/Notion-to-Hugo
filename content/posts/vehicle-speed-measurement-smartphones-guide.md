Introduction
In today's world, technology plays a crucial role in enhancing road safety. One innovative approach is using smartphones to measure the speed of vehicles, particularly those ahead of you. This can help drivers maintain safe distances and make informed driving decisions. In this three-part series, we will explore how to leverage smartphones and advanced technologies like neural networks to achieve this.

1. What You Need to Know About Speed Measurement
Speed measurement involves calculating the distance traveled by an object over a specific period. In a car, speed is typically measured by GPS or vehicle sensors. However, for measuring the speed of the vehicle in front of you, we need to use computer vision and real-time data processing.

2. Key Technologies Involved

3. The Basics of YOLOv8
YOLOv8 is the latest version of the YOLO family, known for its accuracy and speed in object detection. It can identify various objects within a video frame, making it ideal for detecting vehicles.

4. Why Use a Smartphone?
Smartphones come equipped with powerful cameras and GPS modules, making them suitable for real-time data collection and processing. Additionally, with the increasing power of mobile processors, running complex algorithms on smartphones is becoming feasible.

5. Setting Up Your Development Environment
To start measuring vehicle speeds using a smartphone, you'll need to set up your development environment:

6. Capturing Video and GPS Data
You'll use your smartphone's camera to capture video and GPS to get your current speed. Optionally, you can use an OBD-II device for more accurate speed data.

Conclusion
In this part, we covered the foundational knowledge and technologies needed for measuring vehicle speed using a smartphone. In the next part, we'll dive into the practical implementation, including setting up object detection and tracking.
